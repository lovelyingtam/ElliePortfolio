# Ying Tam (Ellie) - Portfolio App Showcase with Android Jetpack Compose

Welcome to my portfolio repository for Android Kotlin Jetpack Compose! This project showcases the power of modern Android app development and is designed to serve as a showcase of my skills as an Android developer. As part of this, I have integrated my own portfolio introduction into the app to demonstrate my ability to create professional-grade apps.

## Technologies Used

- Built with the latest Material Design 3 dynamic theme
- Utilizes popular libraries like Dagger 2 and Hilt for dependency injection, Coroutine for asynchronous programming, Coil image loader for smooth image loading, and Retrofit2 for efficient network requests
- Uses unidirectional data flow (UDF) as a modern design pattern where state flows down and events flow up
- Includes Proguard for security
- Demo of unit tests and simple Android UI tests to ensure that the app meets the highest standards for quality and reliability
- Integrates with the official Material Pull to Refresh components for a seamless and intuitive UI
- Uses Timber for logging and JankStats library for performance tracking
- Utilizes ViewModel to handle the app's lifecycle
- Uses Moshi library to handle JSON
- To optimize app size, this project utilizes Vector Images, which provide high-quality, scalable images that take up less space compared to traditional raster images.

## Usage

This app is intended for personal showcase purposes only and is not intended for public use.
- Knowledge of new and upcoming SDK components in the Android space, including Jetpack Compose
- Good understanding of robust design patterns, and how they can be applied to Android development
- Knowledge of security protocols such as utilizing the Android Keystore to secure data
- Developing with accessibility in mind, ensuring that the app is usable and friendly for everyone

Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) is a design pattern that can be used with Jetpack Compose, as well as other UI frameworks, to manage the state of the UI.

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern commonly used with Kotlin XML in Android development to separate the UI, data, and business logic.

Both UDF and MVVM are patterns that can help to make an Android app more scalable, maintainable, and testable.
